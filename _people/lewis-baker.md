I am a Post-Doctoral Associate in the Departments of Psychology, Mathematics and Computer Science at Rutgers University - Newark. I earned a B.S. in psychological sciences and world religious studies from Loyola University New Orleans before completing my Ph.D. at Vanderbilt University in psychology with a concentration in cognitive neuroscience and certification in quantitative methods.

I use behavioral, psychophysical, and compuational methods to study the factors that guide attention and memory in everyday events. I'm engaged in two major projects with the CODAS lab. First, I'm developing the Mobile Maker Center for the large-scale analysis of children's exploratory play. Second, I'm adapting augmented reality technology to train users' visual systems to better detect specific features in the environment.
