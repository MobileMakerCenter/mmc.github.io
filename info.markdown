## About the lab
The MMC is a collaboration between educators, psychologists and computer scientists. Based out of Rutgers - Newar, the lab is run by Dr. Liz Bonawitz and Dr. Vanessa Lobue in the psychology department and Dr. Patrick Shafto in the department of math and computer science. Researchers at the MMC research how children learn in the real world. Our research blends new technology with scientific theories on child development to find creative solutions for learning.

### What kind of activities will children participate in?
Children will play games and/or hear stories and answer questions that are designed to measure how children learn and reason. Depending on the study, the children might watch some videos and answer questions, play with toys, or interact with puppets.

### How many children can participate?
Studies examining child development often require a lot of kids. We will set up for long periods of time at locations around the community, and we can use any help we can get!.

### How long will you be at a particular location?
True to the "Mobile" in our name, the center moves about quite a bit. We will generally stay at a location anywhere from a day to a week at a time.

### Do our parents/teachers receive a summary about your findings?
Parents/teachers can definitely receive a summary of the results! At the end of each school year (in May), we provide centers and parents that have participated with a newsletter that describes where we are in the process of our work and any preliminary findings.
